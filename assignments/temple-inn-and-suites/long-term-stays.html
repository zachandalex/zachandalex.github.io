        <p>For those who have been called as full time temple missionaries we have a number of available kitchenette
            suites available for a low cost. This allows you to live near the temple in which you are serving.</p>
        <p>The environment that has been built at The Temple Inn & Suites is perfect for our temple missionaries. We
            have a clean and quiet environment that lives by the same standards you would want to be around.</p>
        <img src="images/suite-room-350.jpg" alt="long term stay suite">
        <p>Our suites are 1 bedroom with a king size bed. They are beautifully decorated to match the local temple,
            including pictures or the temple and Christ throughout. There is plenty of room for you to add your own
            touch to the rooms such as family pictures.</p>
        <p>These suites will be your home away from home and allow you all the comforts you need. The living room area
            is tastefully decorated and has seating so you can have visitors come and have a comfortable space to
            visit.</p>
        <img src="images/suite-kitchen-350.jpg" alt="long term stay suite kitchenette">
        <p>Our long term stay suites also feature a fully functional kitchen. You will find a full size refrigerator, a
            stove top, an oven, and a microwave. In select suites there is also a dishwasher. We have also provided all
            of the dishes and utensils needed for you so there is no need for you to provide your own.</p>
        <p>The attached dining room includes a table and seats for 4 people.</p>
        <p>We look forward to getting to know you better during your stay and helping provide what you need. If you have
            further questions or would like to check availability of a room near the temple you will be serving please
            fill out out contact form so we can get back to you with more information.</p>
